## Gradient Button v1\.4\.0

### Description

The purpose of this control was to replace the standard VB command button with a button that was far more configurable and had many more options so that it would require less programming on the part of the developer to use nice looking buttons.

This release corrects a problem with pushing the button several times very quickly and the button would only show the animation once per two quick clicks. Also fixed a bug in the Option Button implementation that would allow an option button to become "un-clicked" (value of false) without having another option button with a value of true. I've improved the modularity of the HSL color code and decided to use HSL blending for the new style borders and for the caption styles.

This should be the last VB release of Gradient Button assuming there are no major bugs. The C++ version (v2.0.0) is coming along quite well, but there is still alot of work to be done. I still have to add an About box, OLE events and code, code tweaking, lots of documentation and lots of testing. It is still probably a few months away from full release.
